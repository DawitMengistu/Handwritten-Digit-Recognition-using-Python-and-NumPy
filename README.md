The Hello World of Neural Network | Handwritten Digit Recognition using Python and NumPy.

This is the classic example of handwritten digit recognition using a neural network implemented from scratch with Python and NumPy. The neural network is designed to classify 28x28 pixel images (784 input features) into one of 10 output classes (digits 0-9).
